🚀 Excited to share my latest project: A Trip Advisor-inspired Web Design!🌍

I’m thrilled to showcase a project I recently completed—a fully responsive Trip Advisor-inspired website built using HTML and CSS with Flexbox for layout design. This project was a fantastic opportunity to hone my front-end development skills and create a user-friendly, visually appealing interface.

Key Features:
✅ Responsive Design: The website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
✅ Flexbox Layout: Leveraged CSS Flexbox to create clean, dynamic, and flexible layouts for organizing content.  
✅ Interactive Elements: Designed interactive components like buttons, hover effects, and image galleries to enhance user engagement.  
✅ Modern UI/UX: Focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing design to mimic the functionality of a travel platform.

This project not only strengthened my understanding of HTML and CSS but also deepened my appreciation for the importance of responsive design and clean code. I’m proud of how it turned out and excited to continue building more projects like this!
